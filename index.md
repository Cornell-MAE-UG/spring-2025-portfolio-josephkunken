My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student at Cornell University's College of Engineering.  I aspire to expand and utilize my engineering skills in the real world in designing and manufacturing new products.  My skills include various CAD and programming softwares, notably Fusion360 and Python.  

My additional hobbies and interests include partaking in Taekwondo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, bouldering, bowling, chess, and leaning French!
