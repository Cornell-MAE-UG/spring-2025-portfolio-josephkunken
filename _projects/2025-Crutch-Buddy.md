For my Introduction to Mechanical Design class during the Spring of 2025, I worked within a group of 5 other members to design and create our own product: Crutch Buddy.

The product aims to meet the needs of those who require the use of crutches during school or work activities.  Normally when sitting down with crutches, the user must lay their crutches against a table or wall, potentially in a precarious position or far away from the user.  To resolve this discomfort, our product serves as a method to secure crutches to a table with minimal effort.

The design process included target audience interviews and extensive prototyping.  This project involved the use of Autodesk Fusion360 to model and design components of the product.  

Manufacturing involved buying materials including a rubber sheet and extension springs from McMaster-Carr, as well as 3D printing the main components of our design.
