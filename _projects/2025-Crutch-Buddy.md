In a team of six, I collaborated to design and develop Crutch Buddy, an assistive device aimed at improving the everyday comfort and convenience of crutch users in school and work environments.

Problem:
Crutch users often face the challenge of safely storing their crutches when seated. Typically, crutches are leaned against tables or walls, which can be unstable or place the crutches out of reach.

Solution:
Our product securely attaches crutches to tables with minimal effort, providing a stable and accessible resting place that enhances user comfort and safety.

Design Process:

- Conducted interviews with target users to identify needs and pain points
- Iteratively prototyped the device using Autodesk Fusion360 for 3D modeling
- Selected materials such as rubber sheets and extension springs sourced from McMaster-Carr
- Manufactured main components through 3D printing

Outcome:
The final design balances functionality, ease of use, and manufacturability, with a detailed final report documenting the process and results.
