CUSail aims to create an autonomous sailboat to compete in the yearly SailBot International Robotic Sailboat Regatta.  In the long-term, CUSail seeks to construct a fleet of autonomous sailboats that can independently navigate across the world to collect oceanic data.

The Mechanical Subteam works to design and construct the physical components of the sailboat, including the hull, sail, deck, rudder, keel, ballast, and more. Throughout the academic year this is accomplished through small-scale testing, 3D model analysis, mechanical/electrical/software integration, etc.

As a member of this subteam, I have worked to install various components including cleats, rubber lining, and carbon fiber coating.  I have assisted with lake testing and gained hands-on experience in iterative prototyping.  Our team placed 1st overall at the 2025 competition.

In the 2025-2026 academic year, I am playing a central role in the design and manufacturing of the boat hull and deck.
