In my spare time, I took on a personal challenge to enhance my SolidWorks skills by creating a highly detailed 3D model of a standard office mechanical keyboard. Using precise, real-world measurements, I ensured the model was built to exact 1:1 scale accuracy, refining my ability to capture intricate features and improve dimensional fidelity in CAD design.
