In a group of 5 members, we physically dissassembled a pneumatic impact wrench using a variety of hand tools to expose each mechanical component of the system.

Here we examine the rotor of the impact wrench:

Finally, the hammer mechanism:

     style="width:60%; margin:20px 0; display:block;">

By examining these components and conducting online research, including finding information on this specific wrench model, we analyzed the fluid mechanics of the system to see how the input compressed air served to provide the mechanical output.
