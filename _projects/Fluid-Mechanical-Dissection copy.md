In a group of 5 members, we physically dissassembled a pneumatic impact wrench using a variety of hand tools to expose each mechanical component and subsystem of the system.  These included the compressed air intake, air regulator, reverse lever, and vane motor.

By examining these components and conducting online research, including finding information on this specific wrench model, we analyzed the fluid mechanics of the system to see how the input compressed air served to provide the mechanical output.

I conducted online research, matched by physical observation and experimentation, to analyze the function and fluid mechanics of several subsystems including the spool valve at the intake, variable orifice valve at the air regulator, as well as the reverse lever at the intake to the vane motor system.

By using fluid mechanical principles such as Conservation of Mass, Bernouilli's Equation, and the Ideal Gas Law, I successfully derived a formula to calculate the output torque of the pneumatic imapct wrench.  Physcial measurement, online research, and analyzing the manual of the specific model served to obtain values for various constants in the system such as the intake pressure and intake volumetric flow rate.

The calculated torque output was approximately 800 in-lbf, very similar to the maximum torque output of 900 in-lbf found in the pneumatic impact wrench model's instructional manual.  The difference can be assumed to be due to various approximations that ignored additional forces and disturbances such as slippage in the system or viscous/mechanical stresses.

This experience allowed me to conduct a hands-on exploration of a fluid-mechanical system and derive the appropriate formula to analyze the input vs output of the system using all of the fluid-mechanical knowledge I possessed.
