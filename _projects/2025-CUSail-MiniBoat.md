I joined the project team CUSail in February 2025.  As an onboarding project to familiarize myself with the SolidWorks software, I was tasked with designing a miniature sailboat.  This included designing the hollow hull, a fixed rudder, a mount for a keel to be later attached, and a shaft for a sailmast to be later attached.
